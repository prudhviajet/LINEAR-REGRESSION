# LINEAR-REGRESSION
<p>You can also download the Iris dataset from this link - https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris/version/2</p>
<p>After downloading the .csv file, load its contents into a dataframe on a Python notebook and perform preprocessing techniques. Now, perform the following EDA operations:</p>
<ol start="1">
  <li>Display a scatter plot showing the relationship between sepal length and sepal width.</li>
  <li>Find how many flowers of each type of species are present in the dataframe.</li>
  <li>Show how the length and width of the petals are distributed by means of a histogram.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, we will use the data to apply regression techniques to predict certain attributes of the Iris flowers dataset.</p>
